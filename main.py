Explanation of the Functions

    get_sentences_containing_word(focus_word, corpus):
        Retrieves all sentences in the corpus that contain the focus word.

    calculate_sentence_diversity(sentence, focus_word):
        Calculates a diversity score based on the variety of contexts and usages of the focus word in the sentence.

    calculate_contextual_relevance(sentence, focus_word):
        Assesses how relevant and meaningful the sentence is for learning the focus word in context.

    calculate_user_familiarity(sentence, user_data):
        Evaluates how familiar the user is with the words and structures in the sentence, based on user history and interactions.

    calculate_srs_urgency(focus_word, user_data):
        Calculates the urgency of revisiting the focus word based on SRS algorithms and user performance.

    Weights:
        Weights like weight_diversity, weight_context, etc., are constants that you can tweak to emphasize different aspects of the sentence selection process.
