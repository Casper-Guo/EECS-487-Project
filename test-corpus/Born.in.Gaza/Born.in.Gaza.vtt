00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The situation is really complicated.

8
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have a war every two years
and we cannot stand it.

9
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People close to us die pretty often.

10
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sea is closed.

11
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tunnels are shut and we can't bring
neither food nor money.

12
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't do anything.

13
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I quit school to help my family.

14
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I collect plastics in the dumps,

15
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as well as debris,
and I eventually sell them.

16
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I help my family with the money I get.

17
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is too hot and I find it difficult
to bear it, since I am young.

18
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I pick up plastics and debris.

19
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am given 5 Shekel
at the end of the day for them.

20
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes,
we find bombs among the debris.

21
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We take them out with care
in case they explode and hurt us.

22
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, we will be able to work
in a better environment after the war.

23
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One day, I found a megaphone.

24
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was weird but also a good thing.

25
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I found it in the bottom of the garbage.

26
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sold it for 50 Shekel which is
what I usually earn for 10 days of work.

27
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I took the money to my family.
I was very lucky.

33
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dad used to have
a soft drinks factory.

34
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were once in the factory

35
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and people started to shout at us
to run away.

36
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We got out and the factory
was bombed immediately.

37
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got scared and felt sorry.
It was also our home.

38
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went back to recover some stuff,
but I could not find anything.

39
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's see if we can recover
something valuable.

40
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something useful.

41
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Careful with that wall, OK?

42
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do not fall over.

43
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My brother Mohamed loved me very much
and took me with him all the time.

44
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was 22.

45
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I saw how he died in a bombing.

46
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was delivering beverages
when he was hit

47
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I saw it myself.

48
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The largest piece of him left
was this size.

49
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have lots of bad dreams.

50
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cannot sleep.

51
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dad's name is Yafar Khdeir
and he is a farmer.

53
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He grows cucumbers,

54
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
tomatoes, peppers and spinach.

55
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our farm is not even
one mile from the border with Israel.

56
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When they come,
they kill and destroy.

57
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This time it was the camel and the lambs.

58
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They destroy everything
that they find in their way.

59
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our farm has 75 acres.

60
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The diggers have destroyed our farm
11 times between 2001 and 2014.

61
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They devastated our land
with their diggers for no reason.

62
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are pacific farmers.

63
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have nowhere to live anymore.

64
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We do not even have drinking water

65
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we have no money
to work the land again.

66
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have been lucky this time,

67
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because no one in our family
nor in the neighborhood was killed.

68
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, the previous time,
one of our neighbors

69
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a lot of people were murdered.

70
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We grow vegetables.

71
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We do not grow bombs, so they don't have
any reason to come bomb us.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

210
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bisan is sad

211
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because her mom and dad are dead.

212
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

213
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

214
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

216
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn't talk to us

217
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If anyone asks, she gets mad.

218
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

219
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

220
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

221
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

222
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

223
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

224
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After they ruined the land,
we have to smooth it and fix it.

225
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to dig another well,

228
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
start growing again

229
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are afraid of walking around our land

230
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because there are missiles
that did not explode.

231
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are afraid of stepping
on one of the missile that can explode.

232
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would like to be an agronomist.

233
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would like to be able

234
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like a regular person.

235
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without bombs.
Without having my home destroyed.

236
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would like to be calm

237
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and live like other children

238
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in the world.

239
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I often think about our situation
and I never see an end.

240
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My dad was an ambulance driver.

241
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He had been driving
an ambulance for 17 years.

242
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He used to collaborate
with the Red Cross.

243
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He picked up the bodies by the tanks.

244
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was his duty.

245
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cannot find
a reason why he was attacked.

246
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you asking me
why they bombed an ambulance?

247
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you ever heard of any war
where ambulances are attacked?

248
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has seriously determined
our future for wrong.

249
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My older brother was a very good student,

250
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with high grades
but he will probably have to quit school.

251
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a sister
who used to study Science

252
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she was thinking about moving
to Literature because it is easier.

253
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, she doesn't think
she can keep going.

254
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My little brother seems to see a spirit.

255
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It scares him to death

256
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and also scares all of us around.

257
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are worried

258
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this issue
can keep affecting him in the future.

259
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He wakes up at night
and stands in front of my dad's picture.

260
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We find him standing there crying.

261
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we ask what's wrong, he says,

262
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"I am sick and tired
of looking at the picture.

263
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want my dad out of there."

264
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We all think his future has been ruined.

265
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am proud he was my dad.

266
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was very sweet to me
and made all our dreams come true.

267
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We had a very special relationship.

268
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were very close.

269
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was indescribable.

270
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one could imagine

271
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he would be gone like this.

272
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has been taken in a terrible way.

273
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cannot sleep. I often have bad dreams

274
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

275
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have weird feelings.

276
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I tell my mom every day I want to die.

277
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A few days ago, I tried to jump
from the balcony but my sister held me.

278
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

279
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

281
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

282
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a shitty life.

283
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

289
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

401
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

406
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

407
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

415
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

418
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

419
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

any water or power supply at home.

475
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
