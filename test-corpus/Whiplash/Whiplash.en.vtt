Tanner, what you doing? It's core only.
I don't have time for alternates.

532
00:43:53.422 --> 00:43:55.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that from drumming?

Oh. So how's it going with,

00:43:58.344 --> 00:43:59.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Andrew] Good.

535
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:01.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I think he likes me more now.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

537
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

538
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:38.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:44.807 --> 00:44:46.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

552
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:51.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The talent at this table,
that is stunning.

553
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:55.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

554
00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:58.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I mean, it's going really,
really well, actually.

555
00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm part of Shaffer's top jazz orchestra,

556
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:03.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which means it's the best in the country.

557
00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:06.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm a core member

558
00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'll start playing in competitions,
and actually I just--

559
00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I found out I'm the youngest person
in the entire band.

560
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:15.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you know who wins in
a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

561
00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Does the studio get you a job?

562
00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:20.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not an actual studio.

563
00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:23.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the name of the ensemble,
but it's a big step forward in my career.

564
00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:27.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.

565
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:30.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?

566
00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:33.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Living up to your title.
-[Travis] I scored a 93-yard touchdown.

567
00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frank] School record, school record.

568
00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:38.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that true? That's fantastic.
-It's Division Three.

569
00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:45.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division Two, it's Division Three.

570
00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:49.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You got any friends, Andy?
-No.

571
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:52.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, why is that?
-I don't know. I never really saw the use.

572
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are you gonna play with otherwise?

573
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lennon and McCartney were school buddies.

574
00:45:56.879 --> 00:46:00.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody
till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

575
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:01.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's your idea of success?

576
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody's idea of success.

577
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:08.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin

578
00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:10.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
at the age of 34
is not exactly my idea of success.

579
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:14.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34
and have people talk about me,

580
00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:18.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who I was.

581
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But your friends will remember you,
that's the point.

582
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:23.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker. That's the point.

583
00:46:23.822 --> 00:46:27.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.

584
00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure they'll make great
school board presidents.

585
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think you're better than us?

586
00:46:31.997 --> 00:46:34.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
-I got a reply for you.

587
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Four words you will never hear
from the NFL.

Okay, guys, get out of here.

592
00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:20.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pick up the new chart by the door
on your way out.

593

Rehearsal 9 p.m. sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.

594
00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:31.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Neiman.
-Mm?

595
00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stick around a minute.

00:47:37.771 --> 00:47:40.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-See the tempo marking on there?
-Uh...

597
00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:43.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Quarter note equals 330." Oh.

598
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a double-time swing.

00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:49.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Oh, yeah.

600
00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:54.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As fate would have it,
I recently stumbled across another kid

601
00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:58.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the practice room
working on his double-time swing.

602
00:47:58.458 --> 00:47:59.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm gonna give him a shot.

00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hey. What's up, Andrew?

608
00:48:11.513 --> 00:48:15.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made Neiman a temporary core,
but with this competition coming up

609
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:19.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanna make very sure
this chart is in the best shape it can be.

610
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:21.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, this one right here, right?

611
00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:25.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I gave Connolly the chart this morning.

612
00:48:26.486 --> 00:48:29.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I wanna do now is just, uh,
give you both a crack at it, all right?

613
00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:32.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Neiman, go ahead, jump on the kit,
we'll take it from the top.

614
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:33.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

615
00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:38.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want you to worry
about hits right now.

616
00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:40.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just tempo, okay?
-Okay.

617
00:48:45.547 --> 00:48:46.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All set?

618
00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:49.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One, two...

619
00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:58.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not quite my tempo. Connolly.

620
00:48:58.518 --> 00:49:01.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. I can take it from the top.

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:03.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can do...
-No. We'll go with Connolly now.

622

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, this to me
is the beauty of Studio Band.

627

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm conducting a little, though.

947
01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They brought back the JVC Fest this year.

948
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They got me opening
in a couple of weeks with a pro band.

949
01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:46.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's great.

950
01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:50.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. It's all right.

951
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:57.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Truth is, I don't think people understood

952
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

953
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't there to conduct.

954
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:06.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo.

955
01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:10.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.

956
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe that is...

957
01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:18.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
an absolute necessity.

958
01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.

959
01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The next Charlie Parker.

960
01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:31.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?

961
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
-Exactly.

962
01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.

963
01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:40.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.

964
01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:45.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

965
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he's laughed off-stage.

966
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:52.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?

967
01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:53.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He practices.

968
01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:58.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind,

969
01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:00.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
never to be laughed at again.

970
01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:02.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a year later,

971
01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:06.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he goes back to the Reno
and he steps up on that stage,

972
01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:10.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

973
01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So imagine if Jones had just said:

974
01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:21.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."

975
01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:26.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

976
01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:29.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
End of story.

977
01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:30.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No Bird.

978
01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:36.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

979
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that's just what the world wants now.

980
01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:42.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People wonder why jazz is dying.

981
01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:51.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album

982
01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:54.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just proves my point, really.

983
01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:58.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are no two words
in the English language more harmful

984
01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than "good job."

985
01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:07.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But is there a line?

986
01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:12.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker

987
01:21:13.159 --> 01:21:15.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from ever becoming Charlie Parker.

988
01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, man, no.

989
01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:20.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

990
01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

991
01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:29.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The truth is, Andrew...

992
01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never really had a Charlie Parker.

993
01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I tried.

994
01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:43.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I actually fucking tried.

995
01:21:43.523 --> 01:21:45.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that's more than most people ever do.

996
01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:50.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I will never apologize
for how I tried.

997
01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:05.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Andrew] I'll see you later.

999
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:06.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1000
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this,

1001
01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:18.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

1002
01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:21.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You understand what I'm saying?

1003
01:22:24.397 --> 01:22:25.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:27.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1006
01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need somebody
who really knows those charts.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:39.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1008
01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:43.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.

1009
01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tanner?
-Tanner switched to premed.

1010
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:51.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess he got discouraged.

1011
01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:55.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Take the weekend. Think about it.

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:34.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:40.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:46.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry. Um...

01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:55.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I actually have this show this weekend.

1021

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:11.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
