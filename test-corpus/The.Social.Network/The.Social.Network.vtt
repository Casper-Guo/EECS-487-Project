An awful lot of people live in China,
but here's my question.

6
00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people...

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.657  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I didn't know they take SATs in China.
-They don't.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:39.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Does that mean you
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:46.255  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
From a woman's perspective...

16
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is serious.

18
00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.971  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.644  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.980  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, delusional?

23
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sometimes you say two things at once.

24
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

25
00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you've seen guys who row crew,
right?

26
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:09.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

27
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.947  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, well,
they're world-class athletes.

28
00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.866  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You said you like guys who row crew,
I assumed you met one.

29
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

30
00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.330  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

31
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:21.832  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Should we get something to eat?

32
00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you like to talk
about something else?

33
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club...

34
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...I think I may have missed a birthday.

35
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.135  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There are really more people
in China with genius IQs than--

36
00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:36.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The Phoenix is most diverse. The Fly
Club. Roosevelt punched the Porc.

37
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:37.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Which one?

38
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.767  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-The Porcellian. It's the best of the best.
-Which Roosevelt?

39
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Theodore.

40
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls...

41
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.607  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

42
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.900  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

43
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, well,
which is the easiest to get into?

44
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.907  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Why would you ask me that?
-I was just asking.

45
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
None of them. That's the point.

46
00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:01.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer...

47
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...and Eduardo won't come close.

48
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The ability to make money
doesn't impress anybody here.

49
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

50
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-He likes meteorology.
-You said it was oil futures.

51
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

52
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.925  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think you asked me that...

53
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into...

54
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...is the one
where I'll have the best chance.

55
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I.... What?

56
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into...

57
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

58
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:26.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one...

59
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...where anybody has the best chance.

60
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.191  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You didn't ask me
which one was best...

61
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...you asked me which one
was easiest.

62
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:34.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

63
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.907  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
-Erica.

64
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.284  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

65
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need someone...

66
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...who will prescribe you medication.

67
00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

68
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

69
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

70
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes. There is.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.344  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That was cryptic,
so you do speak in code.

72
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

73
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.683  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I need to do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

74
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.768  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Why?
-Because they're exclusive.

75
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.770  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

76
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.438  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Teddy Roosevelt
didn't get elected...

77
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

78
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.984  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

79
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.738  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

80
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Did you really just say that?

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.369  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wanna be straightforward...

83
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and tell you I think you might
want to be more supportive.

84
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.375  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings...

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

86
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You would do that for me?

87
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.759  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.971  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:57.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm Cameron Winklevoss.
This is my brother, Tyler.

1200
01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you're here because...?

1201
01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.033  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Either of you can answer.

1202
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I thought you were reading the letter.
-I've read the letter.

1203
01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:08.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection.

1204
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've since changed the name
to ConnectU.

1205
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea.

1206
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:12.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I understand.

1207
01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:15.463  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1208
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:19.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman...

1209
01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.429  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...under the heading "Standards of
Conduct in the Harvard Community"...

1210
01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:25.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming...

1211
01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.143  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...in their dealings with members
in this community.

1212
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership...

1213
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.231  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and instances of theft,
misappropriation or--

1214
01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:34.816  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Anne?
-Yes, sir?

1215
01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1216
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:43.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
--or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action...

1217
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.994  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1218
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1219
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:51.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course--

1220
01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1221
01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:56.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you've spoken
to your House Master?

1222
01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:58.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board...

1223
01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:00.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...but the Ad Board won't see us.

1224
01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Have you tried dealing with
the other student?

1225
01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:06.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls.

1226
01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.016  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door...

1227
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:10.018  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and the closest I've come
to dealing with him...

1228
01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.354  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...is when I saw him
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1229
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You chased him?

1230
01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:16.775  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1231
01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:20.362  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I don't see this as a university issue.
-Of course this is a university issue.

1232
01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:23.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's a code of ethics and an
honor code and he violated them both.

1233
01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.451  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1234
01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:30.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1235
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:31.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm devastated by that.

1236
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:34.459  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What my brother means is, if Mark
Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room...

1237
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1238
01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This office doesn't handle
petty larceny.

1239
01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This isn't petty larceny.

1240
01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.801  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1241
01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Millions?
-Yes.

1242
01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1243
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1244
01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:53.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1245
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Letting our imaginations run away
with us...

1246
01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.565  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...is what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1247
01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:00.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations...

1248
01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-...run away with you on a new project.
-You would?

1249
01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:04.990  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1250
01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:09.452  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1251
01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:13.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1252
01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:16.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
-Please, arrive at the point.

1253
01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.253  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert...

1254
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1255
01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:21.756  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you're saying that I don't?

1256
01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.842  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Of course I'm not saying that.
-I'm saying that.

1257
01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.677  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Sir.

1258

1259
01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.806  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Colleagues of their father.

1260
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss...

1261
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:36.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1262
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:40.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here, is wrong.

1263
01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:44.029  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1264
01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't get special treatment.

1265
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.117  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-Just start another project?

1266
01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:51.119  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If you have a problem with that--

1268
01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We never asked for special treatment.

1269
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:57.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
--the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do?

1270
01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:59.294  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can take the handbook
and shove it--

1271
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:00.503  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Thank you very much for your time,

Eduardo, spring break, you and
Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1275
01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

1276
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, as CFO, I had set up some
meetings with potential advertisers.

1277
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who paid for the trip?

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:28.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1279
01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:30.909  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
At this point,
your $1,000 was the only money...

1280
01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-How did you feel the meetings went?

1282
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.375  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-Why?

1283
01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.667  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was not asleep.

1285
01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:42.462  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can I rephrase my answer?

1286
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.672  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wish he'd been asleep.

1287
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:50.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So we're in 29 schools now,

1288
01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:52.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

impressive statistic.

-Excuse me one second.

1293
01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What sound is he making?
Is that like a tsk?

1294
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It wasn't a tsk.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:10.949  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.510  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.438  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Never mind.

He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:03.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I honestly wasn't jealous.
I was nervous.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:04.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:08.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.885  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.767  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.105  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.550  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.469  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Christy, what do you like to drink?

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.263  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Great. Four of those.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.810  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
From that point on,
it was a Seanathon.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:14.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He took us through his episode

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.300  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We tried to sell the company to pay the

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.932  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car...

1348
01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...to pay for the stolen gas.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.395  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So we said screw it,
declared bankruptcy.

1350
01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.147  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then he went on to
his second business venture...

1353
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.030  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:58.116  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1355
01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:02.036  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but
nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:05.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'm not a psychiatrist, but....

1358
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.670  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1359
01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:13.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1360
01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1361
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:18.428  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:26.185  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Private behavior is a relic

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:29.147  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if somehow, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama...

1366
01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:30.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...they'll make shit up.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1368
01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:36.362  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And they want you to say
"thank you" while you-- Excuse me.

1369
01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
--wipe your chin and walk away.

01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:39.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's what happened to you?

1371
01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And delusional.

01:08:41.409 --> 01:08:44.162  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1373
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:46.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I brought down the record companies

1374
01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:47.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...and Case'll suffer for their sins.

1375
01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1376
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:51.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They won.

1377
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:53.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-In court.
-Yeah.

1378
01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You wanna buy a Tower Records,

1379
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And he told story after story

1380
01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:06.225  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and parties at Stanford and down in L.A.,

1381
01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:11.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But mostly how Mark had to--
He had to come to California.

1382
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:14.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then he got around
to The Facebook.

1383
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So tell me about your progress.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:20.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For instance, we wanted Baylor,

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.793  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You put The Facebook

Here's your $19,000.

01:47:40.955 --> 01:47:42.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You go to a party

01:47:42.748 --> 01:47:44.667  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:46.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We lived on farms

01:48:16.532 --> 01:48:18.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
